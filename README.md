## Purpose
The purpose of the privacy proxy is to ensure users privacy in the EEXCESS system. Each query issued by the clients (e.g., Google Chrome extension, Wordpress plug-in) is sent to the privacy proxy before it is forwarded to the federated recommender. It allows obfuscating or anonymising it when it is required by the user. For instance, if a user does not want to share her location, then the privacy proxy will ensure that this information does not get to the federated recommender.
